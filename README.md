Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize insurance demographics data using Tableau to gain insights into the characteristics of insured individuals. By creating an interactive dashboard, the project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of key demographic factors such as age, gender, occupation, and policy types.

Data Collection and Preparation:
The project starts by gathering comprehensive insurance demographic data from a source, kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravalsmit/customer-segmentation-data?resource=download). The collected data is then cleaned, processed, and structured for analysis. This involves handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data quality.

Dashboard Design and Development:
Using Tableau, a visually appealing and interactive dashboard is designed to present insights from the insurance demographics data. The dashboard consists of multiple visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, to depict different aspects of demographics. Users can filter and drill down into the data to explore specific demographics or compare different segments.

Key Insights and Analysis:
The dashboard allows users to uncover key insights into insurance demographics, such as the distribution of insured individuals across different age groups and regions, the gender distribution among policyholders, the popularity of various insurance products among different occupations, and trends over time. By visually analyzing the data, stakeholders can identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for business growth or risk management.

Conclusion:
By leveraging Tableau to analyze insurance demographics data, this project provides valuable insights for insurance companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders in the insurance industry. The interactive dashboard offers a powerful tool for understanding the characteristics of insured individuals and making data-driven decisions to optimize insurance products, marketing strategies, and customer experiences.
